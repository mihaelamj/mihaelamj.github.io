            Experienced iOS engineer with a deep commitment to modular architecture and elegant code. \
            I specialize in OpenAPI-driven development, building robust, multi-platform Swift applications \
            that scale gracefully. My work is defined by clean structure, extreme attention to testability, \
            and the kind of modularization that makes features easy to extend, reason about, and maintain. \
            I take pride in shipping polished, production-grade software that balances design clarity with \
            engineering precision.
